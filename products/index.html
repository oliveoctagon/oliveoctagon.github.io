    <h2>Excel-centric XBRL reporting software</h2>

    <p>
      Olive Octagon XBRL reporting products are all "Excel-centric". What do we mean by this? Well, all you need is Excel (either installed or in-browser) in order to complete the templates, and everything else is done through your web browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our browser-based processing approach allows market-leading data security. When you access our software, all of the code required to validate and convert the completed Excel templates into XBRL (whether XBRL-XML or XBRL-CSV) is sent to your browser and is executed there. None of your data ever leaves the browser, nothing is uploaded to our servers, and browser-based validation and XBRL conversion means there's no software to install. As long as you can access our website and have a reasonably up-to-date browser (sorry, but the Internet Explorer days are gone!) then you can meet your reporting obligations with Olive Octagon.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
      To learn more about how the software works and how your data is kept secure (i.e. by not leaving your computer), see our <a href="">technical documentation</a> on the subject.

    <h2>Coming later in 2025...</h2>

    <p>
      We are always adding to our range of available products, including different XBRL reporting taxonomies.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Olive Octagon our primary goal is to make the end product as user-friendly as possible. This means that although we use automated process to interpret new taxonomies when they come out (as you'd expect any respectable software company to do), we add our own layer of value in order to achieve the goal of utmost usability. Therefore, we need to invest some effort in development and testing the first time we implement a particular XBRL taxonomy.
    </p>

    <p>
      To give you an idea of what we're working on and what's coming soon, below are the products coming later in 2025.
