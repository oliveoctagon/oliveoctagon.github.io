# FAQ
faq:
  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  questions:
    - question: "What is PRA Liquidity reporting and why was it introduced?"
      answer: "PRA Liquidity reporting is a new regulatory requirement by the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority to enhance supervision of liquidity risks in insurance companies. It was introduced following market crises like the September 2022 LDI crisis and March 2020 'dash for cash', where the PRA identified gaps in firms' ability to provide timely, accurate liquidity data during stress periods."
    - question: "Which insurance companies need to comply with PRA Liquidity reporting?"
      answer: "The requirements apply to UK insurers with significant liquidity risk exposure: those with assets exceeding £20&nbsp;billion on average over three quarterly periods AND either derivatives contracts over £10&nbsp;billion OR securities lending/repo agreements over £1&nbsp;billion. Approximately nine large UK insurers are expected to meet these thresholds."
    - question: "When does PRA Liquidity reporting go live?"
      answer: "The PRA has set the first reporting date as 30&nbsp;September 2026, giving firms a year to implement their reporting solutions before the go-live date."
    - question: "How often do I need to submit PRA Liquidity reports?"
      answer: "Standard reporting is <strong>monthly within 10 working days</strong> of month-end. However, during stress periods, firms must be capable of <strong>daily (T+1) reporting</strong> of approximately 150 key data points. This requires a quick and slick reporting process."
    - question: "What technical format is required for PRA Liquidity reports?"
      answer: "Reports must be submitted in <strong>XBRL format</strong>, as output by Olive Octagon's PRA Liquidity reporting tool, using the Bank of England Insurance Liquidity XBRL Taxonomy. The reporting comprises four templates with approximately 3,000 data fields in total, making specialised software essential for compliance."
    - question: "What are the benefits of using specialised software for PRA Liquidity reporting?"
      answer: "Specialised software reduces reporting cycle times, ensures XBRL validation accuracy, and decreases the risk of non-compliance with the new daily T+1 reporting requirements. Olive Octagon's solution converts Excel spreadsheets into validated XBRL reports in seconds."
    - question: "Is Olive Octagon's PRA Liquidity reporting tool secure?"
      answer: "Absolutely. Our solution runs directly in your browser, ensuring that your sensitive liquidity data never leaves your machine. This approach maintains the highest levels of data security and privacy while meeting regulatory requirements."
    - question: "Can I test the PRA Liquidity reporting process before implementation?"
      answer: "Yes, you can use Olive Octagon's PRA Liquidity reporting tool for free during early access to test your entire reporting workflow. We recommend scheduling a demonstration to discuss your specific requirements and ensure readiness for the 2026 implementation."
    - question: "What's the current status of the PRA consultation process?"
      answer: "The Bank of England's consultation period has closed, and the final policy statement (<a class='underline' href='https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2025/september/closing-liquidity-reporting-gaps-and-streamlining-standard-formula-reporting-policy-statement' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>PS15/25 - Closing liquidity reporting gaps and streamlining Standard Formula reporting</a>) was published on 30&nbsp;September 2025. The implementation date has been moved to 30&nbsp;September 2026, giving firms more time to prepare their reporting solutions."
