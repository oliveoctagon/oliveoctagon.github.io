# FAQ
faq:
  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  questions:
    - question: "What does IRRD stand for?"
      answer: "IRRD stands for <strong>Insurance Recovery and Resolution Directive</strong>, a regulatory framework designed to ensure that insurers within the EU are better prepared for financial distress."
    - question: "What's in the consultation?"
      answer: "The consultation sets out the proposed framework for IRRD data collection, including a new set of reporting templates and draft XBRL taxonomy files. Validations have not been published in this draft taxonomy — these are expected in the second public working draft (PWD2) due to be released in the first half of 2026."
    - question: "How do I prepare for IRRD reporting?"
      answer: "You can use Olive Octagon's IRRD reporting tool for free to test for any gaps in your reporting process. We recommend scheduling a product demonstration to discuss your exact requirements."
    - question: "How do I participate in EIOPA's IRRD consultation?"
      answer: "In order to make the most of the consultation window and be able to provide valuable feedback to EIOPA, we'd recommend getting an IRRD XBRL software solution and try to get all the way through to an XBRL so you can fully identify any issues early. Olive Octagon provides a free tool to do this."
    - question: "When is the implementation date for IRRD?"
      answer: "The first reporting reference date can be any time after 30 January 2027. That may feel distant, but in practice it gives firms little over a year to get themselves ready for live reporting."
    - question: "Who is required to comply with the Insurance Recovery and Resolution Directive?"
      answer: "It is expected that all European insurers that currently report under Solvency II will be required to start producing IRRD reports from 2027."
    - question: "How does Olive Octagon's IRRD Reporting tool benefit my business?"
      answer: "Our tool converts your familiar Excel spreadsheets into validated, regulator-ready reports in minutes, reducing errors and saving time. This allows you to focus on your core business while staying compliant."
    - question: "Is Olive Octagon's IRRD Reporting tool secure?"
      answer: "Absolutely. Our solution runs directly in your browser, ensuring that your sensitive data never leaves your machine. This approach helps maintain a high level of data security and privacy."
